## Radiorecorder & Podcast generator

These short scripts enable you to record radioshows from a webstream, store them on a server and generate a rss-file to download them as a podcast with a podcatcher.

###Installing

To use these scripts, install streamripper on your webserver (in my case a Raspberry Pi):  
```bash
sudo apt-get install streamripper
```
Copy the two files
